# vscode-java

This git repository should in theory contain all **2AHELS-FSST** files... *again* **should**.  

There is a
[second repository](https://github.com/steeplands/intellij-java)
maintained by
[Moritz](https://github.com/orgs/steeplands/people/Moritz-eisl)
containing all files for the **IntelliJ IDEA**, also if certain files are missing or incomplete, his repository likely contains an alternative answer or solution to whatever problem appears.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
